				<p>I was selected as a chaperone for the school's field trip and it was a new experience for me. The job was easier than I expected, like a sheepdog making sure the kids stayed on track.</p>

				<p>We visited a theater for two interactive shows.</p>
				<h2>The first was about modern dancing</h2> <p>The dancer taught the kids some basic moves and gave an introduction to the dance. The performance was educational and gave the kids a taste of what dancing is all about.</p>

				<h2>The second show was a rock band</h2> <p>They taught the kids about rhythm, instruments, and country music. It was an interesting mix of lullaby and rock music. Can you imagine a rap version of "Five Little Monkeys"? Or an ABC song covered by the bass?</P>

				<p><b>P.S.</b> In addition to the professional performance, I have a lot of respect for the teachers and performers who can handle so many kids and keep them in place. What I learned in the army doesn't seem to work for these little ones, so I would like to express my respect and gratitude to these educators.</p>
