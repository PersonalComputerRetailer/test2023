				<p>I had the opportunity to attend the American Indian Festival in Scottsdale today.</p>

				<h2>22 Federally Recognized Tribes in Arizona</h2>
				<p>The festival was a fantastic learning experience for children and adults alike, showcasing the diverse cultures of the 22 tribes in the state.</p>
				<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="banner1.webp" alt="banner descript river tribe names" width="192" height="256px"></p>
				
				<h2>Hospitality</h2>
				<p>One of the highlights was seeing the traditional buildings and architecture, which gave a glimpse into the history and heritage of the tribes. I was also pleasantly surprised to receive gifts from both casinos and board committees.</p>
				<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="bag1.webp" width="256px" height="192px"><img src="bag2.webp" width="256px" height="192px"><br><img src="bag3.webp" width="256px" height="192px"><img src="roof.webp" width="256px" height="192px"></p>

				<p>The traditional performances and music were both entertaining and enlightening. For lunch, we had some cheeseburgers and hotdogs. I am grateful for the chance to visit this festival and discover more about the vibrant culture of the American Indian community in Scottsdale.</p>

				<p><b>P.S. </b>Finding a parking spot was a challenge, as I was not aware of the high attendance. However, the welcoming and friendly atmosphere made up for the difficulty in parking.</p>
