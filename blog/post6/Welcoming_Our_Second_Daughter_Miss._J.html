				<p>In September our family welcomed our second daughter into the world marking the beginning of a new chapter filled with joy and anticipation.</p>
				<p><h2>The sign</h2>
<p>It was late at night, as we prepared to retire for the evening, that I noticed a small trickle of water from my wife's leg. Initially unsure if it was her water breaking, we soon realized that labor had begun. Quickly springing into action, we executed the plan we had prepared for this moment. I made an emergency call to a friend to babysit our older daughter during our hospital stay while I drove my wife to the ER.</p>

<h2>Arrived ER</h2>
<p>Upon arrival, we provided our basic information and the name of our obstetrician, while our friend arrived to take our daughter home. Soon after, we were sent to triage for assessment, where it was determined that labor was indeed imminent, and we were promptly escorted to a labor room. Compared to our first childbirth experience, this night felt more manageable, as we were familiar with the process. Though sleep was elusive, there were moments of rest, and by morning, I managed to grab a quick breakfast before the delivery began.

<h2>Baby's birth</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the delivery proceeded smoothly and without complications, a stark contrast to our previous experience where our daughter's size had led to complications. This time, my wife had been vigilant about her diet, resulting in a natural delivery. Following the birth, our daughter received necessary shots and nutrients, and we remained in the hospital for nearly 48 hours before returning home. The hospital staff provided excellent service, displaying professionalism and kindness throughout our stay.</p>

<h2>Overall experience</h2>
<p>Our experience this time was significantly more comfortable compared to our previous hospital stay. We were fortunate to have a private room for labor and post-delivery, complete with complimentary meals for both of us and access to a private bathroom, which greatly aided in my wife's recovery. As we settled back into the routine of home life with our new addition, the final bill came as no surprise, thanks to our insurance coverage. Overall, the journey of welcoming our second daughter was smoother and more comfortable, leaving us with fond memories and gratitude for the care we received.</p>

<h2>Total Costs: $2583</h2>
<h3>Break down:</h3>
<p>- Hospital: $21986.5 - $20071 (insurence covered ~91%) = $1915 ($750 deductible + $1165 balance due)</p>
<p>- Obstetrician: $75 (co-pay. insurence covered 100%)</p>
<p>- Additional exam, NITP: $250 (In cash. If I go with insurence, it will cost me ~$400. Why?)</p>
<p>- Pediatrician for new born baby checkup: $1394 - $1051 (covered by insurence, ~75%) = $343</p>
